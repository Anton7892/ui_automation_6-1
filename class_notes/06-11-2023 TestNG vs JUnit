Recap:

Page Object Model
-It is a design pattern enables programmers (testers) to store all the elements related to a web page in their respective class (object repository)
-We can also create reusable methods related to this specific page in their respective class
-@FindBy is used to locate elements
-PageFactory and its initElements() method is used in the default contructor to introduce all the web elements with our single driver.


Advantages:
	- Reusable
	- Readability
	- Maintanence of web elements easier

Animal a1; // declaration in the base class

a1 = new Animal(); // initialization in the child class




TestNG:
- Unit testing tool we used for annotations, assertions, reports
- xml files: grouping together the test scripts 
- DataProvider: used to execute same script with different data
- Set priority between tests - ordering purposes
- Help us with parallel testing
- Dependency between test cases




IGNORING SOME TEST SCRIPTs
1. Command out or delete the @Test annotation for the script
	(NOT RECOMMENDED)
2. Use @Ignore annotation on the top of test you would like ignore
	SYNTAX:
		    @Ignore
    		@Test

3. Use enabled=false property next @Test annotation
	SYNTAX: @Test(enabled = false)
