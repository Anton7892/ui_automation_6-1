06-06-2023 Selenium Actions

	To be able to use these operations, we need to create an Actions class instance first and pass driver as an argument to constructor

	SYNTAX:
		Actions actions = new Actions(driver);

		// Then we can use actions to use any mouse and keyboard action

		actions.contextClick(webElement).perform(); // right clicks
		actions.doubleClick(webElement).perform(); // double clicks

		actions.dragAndDrop(webElement1, webElement2).perform();
		// drags the first argument web element and drops it to second argument web element.

		IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure we have perform() chained after each mouse action or it will not perform the action.
